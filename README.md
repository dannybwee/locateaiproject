Very quick and dirty project. Has a lot of improvments I can probably do but this should do the trick.

To run:

1. download all files. 
2. type "npm install" to install all dependencies.
3. type "npm start"
  if error of Cannot find module babel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/runtime/helpers/slicedToArray
  type "npm add @babel/runtime"

4. To use program, type name of country with no spaces. It also does not allow for special characters
  the number on the side is the 2nd parameter, the store requirement
